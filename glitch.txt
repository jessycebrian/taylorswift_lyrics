We were supposed to be just friends
You don't live in my part of town but maybe I'll see you out some weekend
Depending on what kind of mood and situation-ship I'm in
And what's in my system

I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah
Five seconds later I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, ah-yeah
And I'm not even sorry
Nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah

I was supposed to sweat you out
In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone else's playground
But it's been 2,190 days of our love blackout
(Our love is blacking out)
The system's breaking down
(The system's breaking down)

I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah
Five seconds later I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, ah-yeah
And I'm not even sorry
Nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah

A brief interruption
A slight malfunction
I'd go back to wanting
Dudes who give nothing
I thought we had no chance
And that's romance
Let's dance

Glitch, ah-yeah
Five seconds later I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, ah-yeah
And I'm not even sorry
Nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch
