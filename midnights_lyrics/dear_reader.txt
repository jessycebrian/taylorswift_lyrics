Dear reader
If it feels like a trap
You're already in one
Dear reader
Get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run
Dear reader
Burn all the files, desert all your past lives
And if you don't recognize yourself
That means you did it right

Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart

Dear reader
Bend when you can
Snap when you have to
Dear reader
You don't have to answer
Just 'cause they asked you
Dear reader
The greatest of luxuries is your secrets
Dear reader
When you aim at the devil
Make sure you don't miss

Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart

So I wander through these nights
I prefer hiding in plain sight
My fourth drink in my hand
These desperate prayers of a cursed man

Spilling out to you for free
But, darling, darling, please
You wouldn't take my word for it
If you knew who was talking
If you knew where I was walking
To a house, not a home, all alone, 'cause nobody's there
Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care
No one sees when you lose when you're playing solitaire

You should find another guiding light
Guiding light, but I shine so bright
You should find another guiding light
Guiding light, but I shine so bright

You should find another
You should find another
Find another
You should find another
